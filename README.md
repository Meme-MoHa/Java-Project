Game - DoTA2 Team Manager

This is my personal project of a game, programmed in Java. It is a club manager game, where the user is the manager of a e-sport club and will lead his/her team through the biggest DoTA2 Championship - TI. The background of the game is set at Ti6, where the user can choose to create his/her brand new team or use a team that actually compete in the championship.
